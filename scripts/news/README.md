# News Management Tool

This writes a news fragment into a directory called `news/next`, here `next` corresponds to the next version
of `discord-modmail`. If the directory doesn't exist, it means you are in the wrong CWD (current working directory)
or you are running the command for the first time, in which case you need to manually create the folder.

To make a new news fragment, you can run `python -m scripts.news add` or use the poetry task `news-create`. It
will make a new file with a filename using the current date and time, GitHub pull request number and a *hopefully
unique* 6-letter word generated by encoding the news entry text.

When it is time to release `discord-modmail` ðŸŽ‰, the `build` command would aggregate all the fragments present
in `news/next` directory into a single news file for that version.


## Concepts

### Fragments

Fragments are files describing your latest work, created by the `python -m scripts.news add` command. The files
are created in the `news/next` directory.

### Categories / Types
News entries can be categorized, for example as additions, fixes, removals, and breaking changes. The list
of categories is settable with the types setting in [config.toml](./config.toml). While making a news fragment
entry using the `add` command, you would be asked to specify the `type`.
